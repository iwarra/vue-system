Backend ideas:
- Build my own API to allow offset and name query
- User authentication (JW token or similar)
- Refactor pagination when offset is enabled (FE part)


NEW:
- Breadcrumbs 
- Refactor user menu 
- Active link in header doesn't work
- Purchase SVG images
- BaseCard and DualCard components 
- Fill new version of cards with info
- User page inspo - add dummy components and user info card 
- Images sizing in card

- skeleton instead of a loader
- images (names and folder)
- remove unnecessary things like stores, controller funcs etc.
- dark theme update
- new logo
