Backend ideas:

- Build my own API to allow offset and name query
- User authentication (JW token or similar)
- Refactor pagination when offset is enabled (FE part)

NEW:
- Refactor user menu
- table redesign - fixed width to avoid moving in sort
- remove unnecessary things like loading store, controller funcs etc.
- images (names and folder)

- formatter (all in one)
- Intl millions/billions..
- arrows should not be visible (or should be neutral) if they are not used to sort
- dark theme updates
- fill in card with data
- new logo
